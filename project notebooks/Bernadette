Oct 20 8.5 hours  - mostly ethics forms, 1 hour meeting re ARIS, half hour prep game jam 
                  - spent more time than necessary, as I was filling in the forms for both plan A and plan B just in case.
                  Ethics form is now complete, but not appendices. Drafted questionnaires, interview / focus group questions. 
                  Started appendices forms. Searched for letter of implied consent- will have to email ethics coordinator. 
                  Spoke to Peggy & simplified this to only address Plan A & will resubmit new version of forms and appendices
                  if Plan B is necessary.
