02:00         Oct 14th, 2015      still trying to get Xcode working with the ARIS iOSClient -- SUCCESS
00:45         Oct 14th, 2015      helped write up the technical section of the project proposal
02:00         Oct 15th, 2015      Xcode is working for emulating the app, but I spent 2 hours troubleshooting
                                  can't connect to any made games using emulation software -- thus, I'm hoping I can use a real apple device to test on
