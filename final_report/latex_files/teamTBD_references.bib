title={Web 2.0 And Social Learning in a Digital Economy},
publisher={IEEE},
pages={1121-1124},
abstract={The paper provides background theory related to learning and Web 2.0 technologies and describes an innovative application of them to increase people's awareness of Web 2.0 technologies. It is to find answers for two questions: (1) is Web 2.0 technologies appropriate in supporting social learning? And (2) how Web 2.0 supports the process of social learning? Based on the four components of Boisot's SLC, the paper explores characteristics of Web 2.0 technologies and the relationship between social learning and Web 2.0 technologies, which demonstrates that Web 2.0 technologies are able to support social learning. E-learning 2.0 is the application of Web 2.0 in learning, its tenets are creating and delivering personalized, social and lifelong learning through web platforms utilizing Web 2.0 principles and technologies. Therefore, it analyzes blog and wiki resources for e-learning 2.0, ChinesePod, and collaboration systems to demonstrate how Web 2.0 technologies are shaping social learning.},

title={Why we twitter: understanding microblogging usage and communities},

publisher={ACM},

pages={56-65},

abstract={Microblogging is a new form of communication in which users can describe their current status in short posts distributed by instant messages, mobile phones, email or the Web. Twitter, a popular microblogging tool has seen a lot of growth since it launched in October, 2006. In this paper, we present our observations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter's social network. We find that people use microblogging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other.},

title={Beyond Microblogging: Conversation and Collaboration via Twitter},

pages={1-10},

abstract={The microblogging service Twitter is in the process of being appropriated for conversational interaction and is starting to be used for collaboration, as well. In an attempt to determine how well Twitter supports user-to-user exchanges, what people are using Twitter for, and what usage or design modifications would make it (more) usable as a tool for collaboration, this study analyzes a corpus of naturally-occurring public Twitter messages (tweets), focusing on the functions and uses of the @ sign and the coherence of exchanges. The findings reveal a surprising degree of conversationality, facilitated especially by the use of @ as a marker of addressivity, and shed light on the limitations of Twitter's current design for collaborative use.},
